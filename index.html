      <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Young people spend an average of 6.5 hours a day on cell phones, computers and other devices. That doesn't include the time they use screens for school and homework. 'Screenagers: How Much Screen Time is Healthy?' is a documentary that explores how much screen time is too much. Physician and mother of two Dr. Delaney Ruston became interested in this issue when her preteen started begging for a smart phone. Dr. Ruston saw other parents equally confused on how to balance technology with a young developing mind. She decided to delve deep into the science behind screen time to understand how it affects young people's minds and development. Through personal stories and input from leading researchers, SCREENAGERS sheds light on the impact this screen time is having on kids. The documentary explores how learning, playing and socializing online affects teens' developing attention span, fragile self-esteem and moral instincts. SCREENAGERS examines the real risks of failing in school, social isolation and digital addiction. Ultimately, the film explores solutions to handle screen time and provides parents with tools to help young people develop self-control and find balance in their digital lives.</p>
